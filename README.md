# Inventory Management API

A RESTful API built with Node.js and TypeScript to manage a list of items and their locations within a 2D space. This API supports CRUD operations for items and locations.

##  :beginner: About
This API allows management of items (physical goods, equipment, tools, etc.) and their locations within a 2D space. Locations are identified by x and y coordinates on a graph and can have names. The API supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting both items and locations, as well as moving items between locations.

## Architecture

This project implements a three-layer architecture, also known as the multitier architecture. This design pattern separates the application into three logical layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (Controllers)**: Handles HTTP requests and responses. It's responsible for parsing incoming request data, calling appropriate service methods, and formatting the response.

2. **Business Logic Layer (Services)**: Contains the core business logic of the application. It processes data, applies business rules, and coordinates between the presentation and data access layers.

3. **Data Access Layer (Repositories)**: Manages data persistence and retrieval from the database. It encapsulates the logic required to access data sources.

This architecture provides several benefits:
- Separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Flexibility to change implementations in one layer without affecting others
- Better organization of code

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following schema:

```sql
-- Create locations table
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    x DECIMAL(10, 6) NOT NULL,
    y DECIMAL(10, 6) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create items table
CREATE TABLE items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    location_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES locations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Key points:
- The `locations` table stores the name and coordinates (x, y) of each location.
- The `items` table has a foreign key `location_id` referencing the `locations` table, establishing a relationship between items and their locations.
- Both tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for tracking record history.
- The `ON DELETE CASCADE` ensures that when a location is deleted, all associated items are also removed.

## :zap: Usage
This section outlines how to use the Inventory Management API.

###  :electric_plug: Installation & Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd [your-repo-name]
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration, including PostgreSQL database connection details.
   An env.example has been provided in the repository.

5. Set up the database:
   ```
   npx ts-node src/scripts/setupDatabase.ts
   ```
   This will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.
6. Seeding database:
   ```
   npx ts-node src/scripts/setupDatabase.ts
   ```
   Change the file name in main to seed_data.sql for data seeding. You should be able to view datas and tables creation in PgAdmin4 locally.
   

###  :package: Commands
